# UFO-analysis-

Overview:

This project was designed to scrape for data and then organize that data into a webpage that would be used to get information about UFO sigthing data based on 
multiple criteria

Results:

A search is performed by adding the country, time, shape, etc and then querying the data to populate regions that fit the criteria. This query could be changed as 
many times as needed to find what the user wants.

Summary:

A drawback of the webpage is that there isnt a way to show the images. This is what could be improved upon as a point of further development. Additionally there isn't
a way to group the data and then count it or show aggregate analyses on it for users who just want a quick summary.
